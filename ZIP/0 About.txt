Step 3 will fail because we use
src="resources/sap-ui-core.js"
but this file does not exist.
We need to use "Content Delivery Network (CDN)" 
src="https://ui5.sap.com/resources/sap-ui-core.js"
But future use, I will follow the defaut design and make folder 'resources' and file sap-ui-core.js
I do not know how to download like your would JQuery, 
  so I will use that link https://ui5.sap.com/resources/sap-ui-core.js to copy and paste.
I will do for Step 3 but this is going to be a pain for all 38.
  
1] This did not work
2] The file is not formated nicely. (Minifiend)
3] THis file is 904 KB, almost 1 MB. 
I will stick with https://ui5.sap.com/resources/sap-ui-core.js
